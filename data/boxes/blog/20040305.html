    Red vs. Blue
  </div>
  I finally got a chance to watch the <nobr><a href="http://redvsblue.com">Red
  vs. Blue</a></nobr> Season 1 DVDs. It's so hillarious, and everyone should 
  go pick up a copy of it. It's basically a film of Halo scenes in Blood
  Gulch, and the writing on it is incredible. Also what they get out of in
  game play is very impressive.
  <br>
  The one thing that I do wonder about it though is that there is a scene
  with a robot who can only speak spanish, and "Madre de dios" is translated
  as "Son of a Bitch". What are they saying about Mary?

  Today was another required attendance all hands in Mountain View. Now,
  maybe I'm a bit disgruntled by having to go to Mountain View, and don't
  really get a chance to go work in San Francisco today, but the meeting felt
  completely useless. I've been going to these things for the last 4 years, 
  and they are still saying exactly the same thing as they have every time.
  I find it incredibly dissapointing that no progress on the larger issues
  have been made in the last few years, but not terrible surprising. I suppose
  that the larger issues are mountains that need to be moved one pebble at a
  time. But I can't see the new pile of pebbles anywhere.
