    Prejudice
  </div>
  Living in San Francisco (well at least the Bay Area) I feel lucky that I
  am not constantly party to the injustices that exist in the world. But even
  in somewhere as enlightened as San Francisco, I still find people who behave
  differently to you based on your skin color (I almost said appearance, but
  in all fairness I like that people treat me differently because I have a 
  mohawk, and really since that was a choice on my part, it probably does
  reflect my personality in some way).
  <p>
  So anyway, I went to Peets to get a latte this morning (I feel so yuppie now
  that that no longer seems odd) and when I got there, there was a hispanic
  man and black woman standing far enough away from the counter that I assumed
  they had already ordered. This belief was further enforced by the fact that
  there was no one by the cash register taking orders. So naturally I walk up
  to the counter and wait for someone to take my order. When one of the staff
  comes up, I get halfway through my order when the black woman states that
  she was already on line. I felt terrible, recognize that the two of them
  must have been waiting before me to order, and I give my appologies, and 
  walk behind them. She orders a coffee and merrily goes on her way, and he
  orders a medium latte. I then order a medium latte, and give my name so that
  they can call me when it's done. As it turns out, my latte is done before his.
  <p>
  Now the part of me that grew up with happily ever after, and still thinks life
  can and should be fair really hopes that this is just because I had given my
  order before I had walked to the end of the line, and the part of me that
  isn't so optomistic fears it isn't.
  <p>
  Though it does make me wonder what it would take to achieve equality for all
  when the social norms of what to do when waiting on line with no one to take
  your order are different enough to cause this sort of problem in the first
  place.
