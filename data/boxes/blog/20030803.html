    Getting pulled over
  </div>
  So I almost ran a cop off the road today<p>
  I had gone out for a morning drive, and was coming back home along the 92
  and was stuck in the left lane behind an SUV doing 70. I had been watching
  the right lane for a while, and since I had seen no one there, I changed
  lanes in frustration with the slow SUV and accelerated to pass.<p>
  Before I had completed the pass (and while I was still going under 80) I
  saw blue and red lights in my rear view mirror. Fuck! And I wasn't going all
  that fast. I pull over at the first chance I get (I was right next to an exit
  so had to go about a 1/4 mile further) then another cop pulls in behind him.
  Double Fuck! What the hell did I do?<br>
  When the officer walks to my window, this is the conversation as best I can remember it:

<pre>
Officer: So, do you know why I pulled you over?
Me: To be honest, I'm not really sure.
Officer:  Well you almost ran me off the road back there when you changed lanes.
Me: What?!? I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.
Officer: License and registration please

[At this point I pull them out, and he goes back to his car. He comes back a 
few minutes later]

Officer: Thank you. Please go on your way.
</pre>

Whoo-hoo! I almost run a cop off the road, and there's no long-term legal 
consequences. I just wonder what I was going to get with the Karma I
spent there.
