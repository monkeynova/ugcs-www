    28 Days Later
  </div>
  I played hookey yesterday afternoon from work (it was too nice a day to spend
  boiling in my non-air-conditioned cube), and wandered off to the Metrione to
  finally see 28 Days Later. I must admit that the positive feed back I heard
  on it was quite accurate. It was a really good zombie movie. I was especially
  impressed with how it was a zombie movie without resorting to actual zombies.
  It might be the scientific training, but I really like the believable,
  overcome with rage infected that are killable like normal humans as opposed
  to the zombies that take two shots to the head and get up for more. It had 
  good pacing, and some nice pyrotechnics. And the Lord of the Flies esque 
  lack of civilization brings out the inhuman in us development, while it has
  been done before, is still nice to see and provided an interesting contrast
  with the "infected" who were inhumanly raged, but without a control switch.

  As for the alternate ending, well I'm not sure which I prefer. The part of me
  that grew up on Disney likes the happily-ever-after of the original ending, 
  and the part of me that knows life isn't a Disney movie likes the loss in the
  second ending (though the part of me that looks at movies as an artform is 
  disgusted at using a second ending as a way of selling more tickets). I
  propose a compromise therefore: Save Jim, just to Napalm all of them when
  the Jet flies by. Why would you risk global contamination by saving them 
  anyway?
