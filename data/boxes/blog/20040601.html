    24 day 3
  </div>
  This weekend was the annual 24 fest (wherein I have some friends over
  and we watch the entire season of 24 in a day, as this is what I think the
  creators intended). I'm noticing as we're on season 3 now that watching the
  show this way (as opposed to seeing it an episode at the week) has a
  consequence that I wasn't expecting. I don't have the same recall of the 
  previous seasons that I do for other television I watch. It's like cramming
  for a test, and while I do process the information of the following days, 
  it doesn't stay as long as if I had been processing and discussing the
  episodes for a week each.

  Still, I don't think I would do this any other way.

    Bacon Burger Dog
  </div>
  Also this weekend, being the unofficial start to summer, was prime BBQ time.
  I tried my hand at constructing a bacon burger dog. I had heard about this
  from the bacon forum on <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a> and had
  to try it. It's a sausage or hot dog wrapped in ground beef, and then wrapped
  in bacon. The cooking was straightforward, in that you just cook it slowly
  (i.e. at the edge of the grill) and rotate regularly (I so need to get a spit
  and someone to turn it). Apparently this is an homage to Cliff Huxtable 
  (Bill Cosby's character on The Cosby Show) and it was a good to eat as it
  sounds. Especially since the bacon hardened just right a formed a crust 
  suitable for holding the concoction and thus made it so I needed neither a
  bun (since I'm doing Atkins) nor silverware.
  <br>
  Next time I plan on getting fancy and gormet with the ground beef and make
  some good hamburger mix for the bacon burger dog, and I now know what the
  base flavor I'm working with will be.
