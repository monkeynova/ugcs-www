    Scotchtoberfest 2003
  </div>
  Was, from the small bits I remember, a blazing success. I'm still trying to
  work out exactly what to do about image web space, so I don't have pictures
  up yet (and boy where they helpful in figuring out what happened on friday).
  We had a large crowd, and about 20 different scotches to sample. And, if we
  had a lampshade, I believe I would have been "lampshade drunk". Damn Jaime
  for pouring her scotches into my glass, though I suppose I probably should
  have eaten before a heavy night of drinking. At least we didn't actually
  hotwire the forklift across the street, though apparently I promised Lexi
  sexual favors from Jon to do so. That was a surprise to learn on Monday.

    Just let me put pants on
  </div>
  Jaime was ill Monday night, and spent the night on a friends couch in the
  city. She had asked me to bring her car back from the Millbrae BART station,
  so I knocked on the door upstairs, and asked Lexi to come with and drive one
  of the cars back. She said "OK. Just let me put pants on first," and the door
  was closed before I fully processed the sentence. I think I may need to start
  paying closer attention to what's going on around me in the future.
