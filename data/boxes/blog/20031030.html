    California drivers suck!
  </div>
  Now I don't want to overgeneralize, so let me describe how I got that metric.
  I know that California houses somedamn fine drivers. Anyone who can take
  Laguna Seca gets props. But California has a lower percent that grossly
  biases the state average.
  <br>
  Case in point: On the way to work this morning, there was a driver who had
  been tailgaiting me. After hitting some traffic, the car in front of me put
  on his brakes, so I put on mine. I had to adjust and brake harder as he did
  the same in front of me. After I got the stop in full control, I looked in my
  rear view mirror and the guy who had been tailgaiting me was in the process of
  swerving into the guy in the next lane because he hadn't left enough space
  behind me and figured it was better to go into the next lane blindly. He
  did manage to stop, and the car next to him managed to avoid him, and he
  did give me <i>plenty</i> of space after that, but that's my california
  drivers suck story for today.
