    Eye of the Storm
  </div>
  Last week after all that had happened to me I had felt a period of calm.
  It reminded me greatly of the eerie calm that comes in the middle of a
  hurricane, and while I hoped that the peace would last (mostly. I do like
  some adventure) I knew in the back of my mind that more storm was yet to
  come.
  <br>
  So Jaime arrived on a one-way ticket on Monday. Shortly after we get home
  from the airport she asks to borrow my car so that she can get to and
  from the city that night to make it to a meeting she needed to attend that
  night. Hesitantly I said "yes".
  <br>
  The next morning I woke up (I had gone to sleep early to get up for work)
  and she wasn't home, and hadn't left me any voice mail to let me know what
  was going on. I was a little worried, but figured it was probably O.K. and
  told myself I'ld see her that night.
  <br>
  That night happened to be my going away dinner with the Winamp gang, so I
  came home at 11p.m. (drunk off my ass - all you can drink sake can be a very
  intoxicating time) and the car wasn't home (though evidence that Jaime had
  been in the house existed) so I left a voice mail for her of "Where the
  <i>Fuck</i> is my car?"
  <br>
  I hadn't heard from or seen Jaime at all on Wednesday in spite of several
  messages I left for her, and it wasn't until Thrusday that she finally
  contacted me (it took accusing her of ignoring me to get her to call) at
  which point she told me that she had left my car in front of my house on
  Tuesday (with the keys left on my table). I had my doubts, but I rushed home
  (I was in no condition to work at that point) to verify whatever I could.
  <br>
  When I got home I had a letter from the San Francisco police department in
  my mailbox telling me that my car had been impounded. Turns out that it was
  impounded Tuesday morning for blocking a driveway. Well a good friend gave
  me a ride to the police department (where the security was far more lax
  than I was expecting - I think I may need to start shaving my head again) and
  I retrieved my car with the spare set of keys I had left with Andrew and Lexi.
  <br>
  I hope Jaime comes home so we can talk (or at the very least so I can get
  the keys to my house back. It sucks having to get my neighbors to let me in)
