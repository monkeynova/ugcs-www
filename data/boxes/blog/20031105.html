    Tricks of Memory
  </div>
  It's still amazes me the way memory, and human recognition work (and I haven't
  event spent that much time with a child learning those skills). A few weeks
  ago the nice lady who took my coffee orders at Peet's had mentioned that
  she couldn't remember my name because I wasn't in more often than once every
  few weeks. After that though she remembered my name every time (which, of
  course is due to the fact that mentioning it caused her to put the little
  bit of extra effort in to remember it). What really gets me, is that today
  when I walked in without the mohawk, she didn't have any problems recognizing
  me. That's impressive.
