    I'm so proud of C.M.

  He caught his second mouse yesterday. It's nice to have a pet that can help
  with some household chores. He still doesn't go for the killing blow, and
  this time the blood is on my hands (not literally. I gave it a human death).
  It's not as hard as I thought it would be. Maybe I could have made it through
  the rat lab after all.
