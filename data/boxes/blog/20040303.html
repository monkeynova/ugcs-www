    G-String Etymology
  </div>
  Do you know where the term g-string comes from? You're in good copmany.
  Apparently there is no authorotative source for this. The <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?G-string">Merriam Webster</a> and the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/25/G0292500.html">American Heritage</a> dictionaries just leave the origin as unknown.
  <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20030515.html">Ask Yahoo</a> has a few
  interesting selections that all seem reasonable. And a few other sources
  (<a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_296b.html">here</a> and
  <a href="http://www.petticoated.com/saffy22.htm">here</a>) seem to agree
  with the Native American explanation.
  <br>
  It crossed my mind that I didn't know where the term comes from last night
  and tried to do some research. Apparently there's actually enough mystery
  that you could probably write a history thesis on it. Either that or leaving
  the adult filter on when doing google searches like this eliminates the useful
  results - nah.
