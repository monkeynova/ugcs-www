    Singing in the rain
  </div>
  So it finally happened. A lot of the people with whom I talked about coming 
  to work by foot had expressed concern over what would happen in the event 
  that it were to rain. Well this morning there was a thick mist (it's what
  passes for rain in California), and I have to say that I didn't melt on the
  way to the office. As a matter of fact it was kind of nice.
