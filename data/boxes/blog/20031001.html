    Allied Driving School
  </div>
  I was driving to work this morning when traffic began to get heavy so I had
  more of a chance to look at the debris on the left shoulder next to the
  freeway divider. What should I see but the triangular prism of an "Allied
  Driving School" roof attachment laying serenly and visibly in the shoulder.
  Now should I think "what was the school doing taking a student driver on 
  a freeway" or should I think "the poor student who recieved that introduction
  to the freeway system"? I think I'll just hope that it was an off-duty
  instructor, though I don't think that bodes well for the future of drivers
  in this state...
