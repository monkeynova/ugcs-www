    Metallica
  </div>
  So AOL Music comp'ed me a ticket to the Godsmack/Metallica show tonight.
  It was absolutely incredible. I stayed on the floor, where from what I gather
  the objective is to push your way as close to the band as possible. Unless
  of course you're about to pass out or are under too much pressure (in a 
  physics sense, not a psychological one), in which case you are pushing the 
  other way about as hard as you can.<br>
  It was absolutly incredible to see the bands in person. I wish I had started
  going to concerts earlier, as I imagine I will continue to do this in the
  future. And one of the remarkable things, is that I had only one ticket, so
  I went by myself. Contrary to my expectations, I actually still had a blast.
  And I don't know if I could have stayed with anyone, if I hadn't gone alone,
  but that's an experiment I'ld like to try some day.<br>
  As for going alone, there's something about a Rock concert that puts chicks
  in heat. It was absolutly incredible the response I got from being in the
  croud. It's been a while since random women came up and grided on me, and 
  just grabbed my hand, and, well, something other than my hand.<br>
  All in all a good time. I must find a way to thank the person responsible for
  my ticket appropriately.
