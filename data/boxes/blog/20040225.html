    It's been a while
  </div>
  Since I've seen the way the candles light your face...<br>
  It's been a while<br>
  But I can still remember just the way you taste<br>
  <p>
  Seriously though, it's been a while, so there's a bunch of updates

    Most humbling moment
  </div>
  I've been paying attention to the f***edcompany.com personals, and one
  of the questions they ask is "what was your most humbling moment?" I always
  felt weird because I couldn't come up with a humbling moment. I mean I went
  to Caltech explicitly for a humbling experience, and it certainly took down
  my ego several notches. The problem is that it was a slow 4 year effect, and
  there was no single moment I could point to that took the lion's share of
  my ego.
  <br>
  Then today I came up with my most humbling moment. It will be the moment
  when I give up on a fairy-tale romance. The day I give up on the theory
  of love at first sight and happily ever after.
  <br>
  I noticed today that I still firmly believe in all of the disney-esque
  childlike romanticism, and that if I continue to actually try to expose
  myself to people to try and date I'm probably going to give that up. It seems
  likely that there will be a point where I give up, and just start looking
  for the best that I can get as opposed to waiting and hoping for perfection.

    Thrice in three weeks
  </div>
  I've had to talk with the police. While I've always heard the curse "may you
  live in interesting times," I'm still out on whether it's a blessing or
  curse.
  <ul>
  <li>
    The first time I had to talk with the police involved some banking fraud,
    and due to the people involved I won't go into it any further
  <li>
    The second time was when Ishy broke out of the house. I had to leave him
    home one day, and there was a thunderstorm which freaked him out a lot. He
    actually was so scared that he broke through one of my living room windows
    and was wandering the street and the police where called to collect him.
    I was able to get him back with a minimum of problems, but it did change
    how I treat him alone. I think his training with separation anxiety is
    going well.
  <li>
    And the third time I had to talk to the police involved an accident that
    came close to taking my and Ishy's lives (<a href="http://genghis.winamp.com/~keith/galleries/20040209/accident/">pictures</a>). 
    We were out for our morning walk and where just turning the corner with no
    stop signs (that really I've been thinking needed signs, or at least a
    clear right of way, since I got here), when I heard the two vans collide
    behind me. I turn and jump out of the way (as does Ishy thankfully) and
    watch the two van mess crash through the fence where I had been standing.
    I told the police after they arrived what I had seen. I really hope that
    they put some stop signs in place.

    Opening your heart
  </div>
  Today I went to see the Lion King musical in the theater in San Francisco.
  It was absolutly marvelous. The animals where beautiful, and creativly
  constructed. And the talent was marvelous.
  <br>
  It reminded me of something I had been meaning to put down for some time.
  I've been out to a few things in the last few months that hadn't really 
  done before. Cirque du Solei and the Transsiberian Orchestra. All of these
  performances have stirred some long dead parts of me that I think are called
  emotions :). It might just be that since Jaime moved out, I've been
  rekindling the part of me that actually cares about life. And the thing is
  that even the pain, even the hurt and the hard times seem better the the
  emotional void that had been there before.
  <br>
  I had for too long been of the opinion that it was better to maintain an
  emotional equilibrium than to ride a roller coaster. (Since, after all,
  every moment of pleasure is purchased with an equal moment of pain). But
  I'm not so sure of that anymore. I'm starting to think that maybe I need
  to go out and get my heart broken a few times so that I can enjoy the
  highs.
  <br>
  Then again, it's possible that the emotions run like any other drug, and it
  would take more and more for me to get my fix if I start to indulge. Well I
  think it's time for some empirical evidence one way or the other.
