    Chinese curses
  </div>

  They say there is an ancient chinese curse: "May you live in interesting
  times." Well the last week sure has been interesting. And I haven't written
  anything yet because I was waiting for the 3rd thing to happen. They say
  bad things come in 3s. And that's not true. Especially in this situation.
  It's more that unlikely things come in 3s. (Given a poisson distribution
  of unlikely events like radioactive decay, short intervals are more likely
  than long and so forth). Anyway I digress...

  <p>

  First off, I quit AOL. April 30th will be my last day, and I hope that they
  return my soul along with the unused vacation time. I didn't read the fine
  print to carefully, but I'm hoping that they only have temporary possesion
  while they give me a paycheck. And now I'm off to 
  <a href="http://topix.net">Topix.net</a>. I'm incredibly excited about the
  new opportunity, and the chance to get to work on some algorithmically 
  interesting problems again. I really hope the brain rot is only on the 
  surface.

  Next I was dumped from a relationship I wasn't even sure existed. (That's
  probably a good indicator right there of why I was dumped -- whoops). I was
  sitting there trying to read the signs for what 
  <a href="http://www.intellectualwhores.com/masterladder.html">ladder</a> I
  was on, and I guess I'm not too good at reading the signs. One way or the
  other.

  <p>

  And finally I found out that a close and dear friend of mine (with whom I
  don't maintain nearly the contact that I should) just got out of a 4 year
  relationship herself. Since she lived on the other side of the country it's
  a lot harder for me to know what was (and still is) going on. It does put
  my problems into place, and I hope she can make it through this trying time.

  <p>

  Well that got depressing...Maybe I should have put them in the other order,
  but that's the chronology, and I try not to re-order history to tell a good
  story unless I'm working up to a punch line. Anyway working for a start-up
  news aggregator, I'll either be spending a lot more or a lot less time
  updating this. Time to decide "You karate do: O.K. You karate no do: O.K.
  You karate so-so: Squish, just like grape." Hey look at that I leave it on
  another depressing note.
