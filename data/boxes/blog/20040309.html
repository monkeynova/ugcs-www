    Metallica (Part II)
  </div>
  Well there's a few things I forgot to write down last night as I was passing
  out from mosh exhaustion (and perhaps a little CO2 poisoning/heat exhaustion.
  I was feeling pretty light headed at times in the croud). I hadn't thought
  of the concert as a family event, but there was a dad showing his 10 year
  old son the ropes of Rock 'n Roll by making sure his son got a good view
  when the flashing started. That's a special kind of dad, though the
  "strong moral fiber" voice in me is saying that I'm going to be paying for
  10x10 housing for that kid some day.<br>
  And there's something else, that I still can't remember...ah well, too much
  second hand "smoke" at the concert.<br>
