    Arianna's In!

  And I'm even more confused now about the recall in California. On the one
  hand, what the fuck did Gray Davis do wrong? And is it worth the time and
  money of a recall? Certainly not. But it is in the state consitution, so 
  I hope this means it's time for a refferendum to change that, though whether
  or not that would succeed depends greatly on how the recall goes.<p>
  And as for my friends pushing me to run, while that's fun and all, I really
  don't want to actively take part in such a ridiculous process. I'm ok, with
  the lazy, let-them-do-everything approach, but now that it comes down to 
  filling out paperwork on my own, and waiting in line at some county seat, 
  I can't do it.<p>
  And finally Arianna Huffington <a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/special_packages/recall/6471245.htm">announced</a> her intentions to
  run in the recall. I'm happy that there will be a strong Democrat in the 
  running, and I would absolutely love to have someone that smart and well
  spoken as governor, I really hate that if she wins, the victory will be
  tarnished by the process.

    Shaving
  </div>
  Watching <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Queer_Eye_for_the_Straight_Guy/">
  A Queer Eye for the Straigt Guy</a> is really having a toll on me. I've been
  keeping my place neater and cleaner, and what's more, I've been shaving on
  a daily basis. The grooming expert had mentioned how shaving was the simplest
  way to show that you care about your appearance. I'm not entirely sure if
  this is still the simplest way when you're shaving 80% of your head, but 
  let's assume it's up on there on the list.<p>
  Not only have I actually started shaving regularly, I've also been using
  (gasp!) shaving cream and aftershave. And I spent some time researching
  the whole with/against the grain thing. What it looks like (from my studies
  and my experience) is that you should shave with the grain first. Take care
  of most of the hair, neatly. Then work (carefully) against the grain for the
  tough spots. This seems to give me a really close shave, though I don't have
  long term studies. Also I've found that using a towel to dry off also gives
  me an idea of how close the shave is. If the towel catches anywhere during
  the drying process, there's still some stubble there.
