    His father was an orangutang and his mother was a pack-mule

  So yesterday I went <a href="http://xkey.com/keith/galleries/20040606/royal_arches/">mountain climbing</a> for the first time outside of the gym.
  It was an absolute blast. 1200 vertical feet of rock face that Mike, Pat,
  and I scaled with just ropes, shoes and cams to keep us safe. The views
  were absolutely incredible, and since it was my first time to Yosemite I had
  never seen them before.

  Of course what goes up, must come down, and we hiked back a "trail" to get
  back to the car. The trail was just inclined enough where we no longer needed
  climbing shoes, but I still would have called a great deal of what we did
  to get back climbing not that long ago.
  <br>
  Still it was a great trip, and mroe work than my legs have ever done in a
  single day before. I can't wait to go on another expedition.
