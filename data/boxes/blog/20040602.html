    Open Source interview on NPR
  </div>
  Jogging in the morning has finally paid off. I was listening to NPR as
  I spent my time on the treadmill this morning, and heard about an upcoming
  interview with an Open Source proponent that would be on as I drove to
  work. So I listened to it, and there was one thing that was said that really
  impressed me. The interviewee was discussing Stallman's nazi-esque positions
  on closed source software, and saying how he (Stallman) viewed it as almost
  an ethical violation to which the interviewer then compared his views to
  that of downloading music off of the internet. It was a great juztaposition
  to think of corporate closed source software, and RIAA instigated lawsuits
  in the same light.

  I made the mistake today of leaving my portable radio on the rest area of
  the treadmill (I didn't have pockets this morning since those shorts were
  in the wash), and towards the end of my jog I turned from NPR to some classic
  rock to help push through the last mile, heard a couple of good Guns 'N Roses
  riffs and got so pumped that I slammed my hand down on the earphone cable and
  shot the portable radio right across the room behind me. Luckly nothing other
  than my pride was hurt.
