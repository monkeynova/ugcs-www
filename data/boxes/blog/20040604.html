    Fuck the MPAA
  </div>
  I got a notice from my ISP yesterday that someone had been downloading
  copyrighted material through my IP address. They actually included the
  e-mail that the MPAA had sent to them. Basically they sent me a cease and
  desist with a pointer on how to secure a wireless router so that whoever
  had been downloading the copyrighted material (because I would never do that)
  could no longer continue. It was actually a pretty sound warning from them
  with some very sounds security warnings, and I'm glad for how they handled
  it.

  The thing is that the letter from the MPAA included what the infringing
  material was and it turns out to be a TV show. Now I thought that most of
  what the MPAA cared about as far as internet downloading was movies 
  (especially after acually putting some people in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/06/04/film.piracy.reut/index.html">jail</a> for 
  camcording), but I guess I was mistaken. I guess even stuff that is broadcast
  free over the airwaves is still a big deal to have on the internet.
  Guess now that someone is zealously checking my IP address, I can't use bit 
  torrent to download mozilla any more.
  <br>
  And of course all this happens the day that my suprnova.org t-shirt arrives
  in the mail. There are certainly moments of incredible co-incidence in life.
  <br>
  P.S. - Since I was reading this with my <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a>
   account, I got some ads along with the message. It was impressive how
   accurate the ads were for the page. One was even an article written for
   people who run small ISP's about the legal implications of copyright 
   violations by those they service.
