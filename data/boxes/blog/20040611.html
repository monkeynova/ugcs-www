    10k run
  </div>
  I did it!!!! Today I ran 6 and 1/4 miles which for those who don't like SAE
  works out to 10 kilometers. And I did it in just under an hour, so that one
  of my criteria that I had set myself as part of the "get in shape before/when
  I turn 25" is made. The other two goals weren't quite as analytically defined
  as this one, but the goals have been (since January at least, prior to that
  I hadn't subdivided the "get in shape when i turn 25" goal)...
  <div align=left>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Lose weight</b><br>
      (mostly this was get under 200lbs, which I have done.
      Unfortunately, now that I'm here I see I still have quite some distance
      left to go)
  <li><b>Be able to run for an hour straight</b>
  <li><b>Be able to bench what I weigh</b><br>
      (this was so that if I kept losing weight
      the strength requirement might be lessened. I really aught to start
      putting some effort into this beyond bouldering).
  </ul>
  </div>
  Well anyway I've still got two weeks left. We'll have to see where I end up 
  then. And I get to reward myself with a backpacking trip right after.
