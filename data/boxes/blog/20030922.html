    Apathy
  </div>
  So it's been a while since I've written here, so I figure the best place to
  start is with some thoughts on apathy. And though I have always prided myself
  on my apathy (it was too much work to think about how it didn't deserve
  pride), I must admit, I've actually had a slight decrease in the last month.
  <br>
  And while I haven't left to soul-sucking environment of AOL (sorry just 
  Time Warner now), I did register to vote, and have actually been getting out
  of my house to spend time under that ball of fire 93 million miles away.
  I guess I can attribute that to me new roommate, so lets move on to...

    Jaime
  </div>
  Jaime moved out to the Bay Area at the end of last month, and is currently
  living with me. She, dad and I <a href="subpage.shtml?media">drove</a> out
  from New York and had a hell of a time on the drive. I was very glad that I
  could enjoy a cross-country road trip again after the New Orleans fiasco.
  <br>
  It's been really good for me to have Jaime out so far. She's been getting me
  to go outside and spend time away from the T.V. And she's also been making
  me watch more football. I've been meaning to pick up some of the subtleties
  of the sport (yes, go ahead and insert some joke about oxymorons if you need
  to) for a while, so it's good to have someone to learn from about it.
  <br>
  And it's just nice to have some family within 1000 miles, and to have it
  within 100 feet is wonderful. And it gives me someone to go see new movies
  with...

    Underworld
  </div>
  Was actually a very enjoyable movie. It didn't fully remove the taste of 
  the summer crapfest, but I did enjoy watching it. Granted you have to want
  to see vampires biting werewolves to enjoy the movie, but it delivered on
  it's promise of cross-supernatural-evil fighting. I was slightly disappointed
  that they took the time to develop special bullets to defeat each
  (silver nitrate to kill the werewolves, and ultraviolet ones to kill the
  vampires) and yet didn't fully flush out some of the armed violence scenes.
  But it did mean that the few bits of supernatural violence that occurred
  were special and hit you all the harder.
  <br>
  Naturally the plot was not the selling point of the movie, but there was a
  little mythology thrown in during the talking scenes which helped them out
  some, but not nearly as much as the corny lines that were delivered by the
  sacraficial stupid male scheming for control.
  <br>
  And I had forgotten how much I love to look at skin-tight black plastic 
  clothing, and corsets. And together, they are simply amazing.
