    And China makes three...

  So the first teikonaut took off yesterday. With Russia not able to afford
  their current space program, and the United States fleet of space fairing
  vessels land bound after Columbia, it may well be time to have another player
  in space. My hopes are that this leads to future exploration, and scientific
  knowledge, and that the cost is something the Chinese people can bear.

  It is disappointing however that we won't give funding for science and
  research in it's own right, but we will give funding for the sole purpose of
  beating the other person. And I'm not sure whether the "we" I just mentioned
  there applies to just people in the United States or if it's a part of the
  human condition...

  Elvis Lives! In a retirement home in Mud Creek Missouri. And there is an
  egyptian mummy stealing souls there. Bruce Campell did a compiling portrayal
  of The King and got to deliver some of his classic attitude as a geriatric
  Elvis. The character was well thought out, and certainly made me think about
  the lives of the elderly. And the current mythology around Elvis provided
  a wonderful gateway of discarded disbelief to the soul-sucking mummy.

  Very good movie. I highly recommend it.
