<h2>Inscribed Triangle</h2>
What is the length of the side of an equailateral triangle inscribed in a
circle of radius 1?

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Statement</th><th>Reason</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Triangle ABD is inscribed in the circle with center at C.</td>
<td>Construction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AC, BC, and DC are all length 1</td>
<td>They are all radii of the circle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>If we continue DC until it intersects AB at E, the two lines meet at right angles</td>
<td>Since the triangle is equilateral, DC bisects angle ADB and so the two angles
at E are equivalent and add up to 180 degrees (*)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Angle CAE is 30 degress</td>
<td>AC bisects angle DAB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AE is length sqrt(3)/2</td>
<td>It's part of a 30-60-90 right triangle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AD is length sqrt(3)</td>
<td>AD is twice the length of AE</td>
</tr>

(*) - I left out a few steps from a completely formal proof, but you get the idea here
