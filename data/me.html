<H1>So you want to know about me do you...</H1>
<BR>
Well currently I am a junior at the California Institute of Technology
(<A HREF="http://www.caltech.edu">CalTech</A>) and am majoring in
<A HREF="http://www.cs.caltech.edu">Computer Science</A>. Since I am a
CS major, you may well expect that I have no creativity, and if so good.
That means you'll forgive my web site.<BR>

And you know what. I've decided not to waste bandwidth with my life story.
It's pretty boring, and so I'll save you the time of reading it. Besides,
I've alread covered the important stuff. But for contact info, see below...<P>
