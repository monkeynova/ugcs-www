<h2>Necessary information to connect to my waste network</h2>
<ul>
<li>The waste client: <a href="waste-setup.exe">waste-setup.exe</a> (win32 only for now. I'll be sure to put up a linux build (and source) when I get one working)
<li>My waste public key: <a href="waste.pub">waste.pub</a>
<li>The IP address of my server: <b>66.92.29.149</b>
<li>The waste network name: <b>fgd</b>
</ul>
<h2>How to get the software to work</h2>
Upon initial startup, you'll set up your nickname, and network preferrences.
Remember to set the Network name/ID to be fgd. The only way to get your public
key out of the system is through the "copy public key to clipboard" button,
so make sure you do that so you can send me your public key and I can let you
in. As soon as I've added your public key to the server, I'll let you know and
you can just add the IP of my server to the connections widget.
